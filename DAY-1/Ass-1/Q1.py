'''Q1. Write a program that asks the user for their name and age, then prints a sentence like:

Code

name=str(input("Enter your name: "))
age=int(input("Enter your age: "))



print("Hello",name+", you are",age,"years old!")

#Alternative print method 

print(f"Hello {name}, you are {age} years old!")    # format --> (f"whatever you want to print {variable},also use comma as you want then {variable}")
